# Formin-C
A chess engine made in Fortran

## The name
The name for Formin-C comes from the [Formin protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formins), I choose formins because they have 'for' in their name, like Fortran, 'min' for the [Minimax rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and the -C tail just means chess.

## Why fortran?
I chose fortran as I really like the language (e.g the error as value treatment, like Go does).

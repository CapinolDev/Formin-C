# Formin-C
A chess engine made in Fortran. 
Update: As of 20.10.25, the Engine.f95 file is not to be updated anymore, the UCL will continue.

## The name
The name for Formin-C comes from the [Formin protein family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formins), I choose formins because they have 'for' in their name, like Fortran, 'min' for the [Minimax search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) (the engine uses [Negamax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax)) and the -C tail just means chess.

## Why fortran?
I chose fortran as I really like the language (e.g the error as value treatment, like Go does).
